Introduction: In my point of view, this is very common to think and discuss about, why do we need array for storing datas 
              and values, if we have variables to store any type of values entered by user, then why array?
              Let's get dive into this question with the help of example. Let us take we need to store marks of three 
              students as shown here: 
      Example:let marksOfStudent1 = 85;
              let marksOfStudent2 = 95;
              let marksOfStudent3 = 97;
              console.log("Marks of Students: ");
              console.log(marksOfStudent1);
              console.log(marksOfStudent2);
              console.log(marksOfStudent3);

Now, suppose principle told to display marks of three more students. At this time, the task doesn't looks much
hetic and again declaring three more varibles along with three more console.log() statement to store and display
the marks of another three respective students. If there is instruction to store and display marks of another 
50 studets, then again writing code for each students i.e., for another 50 students individually, which is 
very quite boring an dtime taking task. Actually, the user has to store and display the marks of each students 
individually i.e., one by one and which is ofcurse a time taking and boring and unnecessary task to do. Now, let's 
considered, if we have more than 500 students. Just think, as a user you are told to write code for more than 500 
students. Isn't the hectic and time taking task for you. Declaring variables, storing marks and then displaying 
values for 500+ times. Ohh God, its too hectic to do. And, if you observed about the marks of students, these are 
the values of same type i.e., the number type. Thus, we are in such situation where there is a need of something 
which is capable of storing such huge number of values, for example marks of 500 students and solve the problem and 
hence we don't need to write code for each values/elements individually. Thus the term "Array" is coined, which is 
capableof storing and displaying several number of values/elements together under a single variable name. Let's 
discuss array in depth.

Array : Array is the most basic and special data structure to store ordered multiple items.JavaScript Arrays are the 
        objects which is sued to store multiple items/values irrespective of their data types under a single variable. 
        In fact, Arrys not only provide a way to store multiple values but it also provide a way to access them randomly 
        in constant time which is O(1) timme cmplexity. 
      ->In JavaScript, array is a single variable as well as the most basic data structure and a special type of 
        object to store and manipulate ordered collection of values of same or different datatypes. An array is 
        used to store a collection of ordered values/elements of same or different types in a single variable.
      ->An array is an ordered collection of values.
      ->Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic in nature i.e., JavaScript arrays are resizable. They can grow or shrink 
        as needed and hence, there is no need of declaring its fixed size while creating the array.
      ->JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays in nature.
      ->Each value in JavaScript array is called an element and each element has a numeric position in the array, 
        which is known as its index.
      ->JavaScript arrays are zero-based indexing and 32-bit indexes. The first element is at index 0, second is at 2
        and so on. The highest possible index is 4294967294(2^32-2).
      ->Whenever we want to store multipe items/values in a single variable, then array is used. It can store values of
        same data type as well as it consists of values of different types.
      ->In JavaScript, elements of array has an index which is associated with it and using the index, the respective value
        of the array can be accessed. Like other programming language, in JS index of array start with 0 and index of last 
        element is (n-1), where n is the size of the array.      
      ->JavaScript arrays can dynamically grow or shrink in size as elements are added or removed.  

        Examples : let arr = [12, 21, 90, "Hello", "World", null, True]; 
                     index =  0    1   2      3       4      5     6
                     name of array : arr
                     size(n) : 7
                     first index : 0
                     last index : (n-1) => (7-1) => 6  
                  

Notes: In other programming languages, multiple items/values is stored in arrays, but those items should be of same data 
types. We cannot add a string value in an array of integer(number in JS) type. But, in JavaScript, we can add multiple
items of different datat tpes. In JS, we can add a string value in an array having other items of string, null, undefined, 
and float types as well as the array also has a separate array. We have the privilegeto store any data type in an array be 
it number, string, null,undefined float, or even an array can be stored inside an array.      
 
Declaration of an Array:We can create/declare array either by using Array constructor or using the JavaScript Array literal
                        which is shown below with syntax:
                      1]Using JavaScript Array Literal:
                        Syntax : let arrayName = [];  
                        
                        Example: let fruits = ["Apple","Orange","Coconut","Lichi"]; 
                                 console.log(fruits)    
                      2]Using Array Constructor:
                        Syntax : let arrayName = new Array(); 
                        
                        Example: let fruits = new Array(4);
                                 fruits[0] = "Apple";
                                 fruits[1] = "Orange";
                                 fruits[2] = "Coconut";
                                 fruits[3] = "Lichi";
                                 console.log(fruits);    

Note: It is recommended that, to create an array use JavaScript array literal and should avoid declaring/creating array 
      using array constructor. This is because, new keyword is quite slow due to calling of array constructor while array 
      literal is much faster as well as it is readable than array constructor.  

->Arrays in JavaScript having items of same data-types as shown below.
  Example : let studentName = ["Mrityunjay kumar", "Mrinal Sauraj", "Vani", "Sushma"]; // items of string type.
            console.log(studentName);

->Arrays in JavaScript also having items of different types. Let's understand following example: 
  Example : let studentInformation = ["Mrityunjay Kumar, "MCAL0030", 98.36, 11, undefined];
            console.log(studentInformation);

            let laptop = ["Lenovo", 56000, true, "black", undefined, null];
            console.log(laptop);

->We can even stodre an array in JavaSCript's arrays as shown in below example:
  Example : let carsDetails = [["BMW", "Audi, "Mahindra"], "Black", "150 KMPH", 40]; 

Now, let us talk about some terminologies that is generally spoken while discussing JavaScript arrays mentioned as below: 
1.Array Element.
2.Array Index.
3.Array Length.

1.Array Element : An individual value/item which is available inside an array is known as array element. And each element
                  in an array can be accessed by its unique index.
                  Example: 
                          let num = [11, 23, 34, 100];
                              here, 11, 23, 34, 100 are the array's element.
                          
2.Array Index : Array index is a numeric representation for an array element's position within the array. JavaScript array
                is zero-based indexing which means, index start from 0 i.e., array's first element is 0, second element is 
                1, third element is 2, and so on. Its last index value will be length minus one(length-1). Array index is a 
                crucial concept which is used for unique identification and accessing the element of an array by specifying 
                its position in an array.
                Example: 
                        let num = [11, 23, 34, 100];
                           index->  0   1   2   3

3.Array Length : Array length represents the total number of elements stored/available within an array. It is generally used
                 to count or identify about the total number of elements/values stored within an array. JavaSCript provides 
                 us a specific property/method i.e., length property which is used directly in the program to calculate the 
                 length of an array. Below is an example to calculate length of an array.
                 Example:
                         let myCars = ["BMW", "Audi" "Brezza", "Mahindra"];
                         let lengthOfCars = myCars.length;
                         console.log("Total Length of myCars: " + lengthOfCars); // Total Length of myCars: 4

                         let num = [10, 20, 50, 76, 55];
                         console.log(num.length); //5
