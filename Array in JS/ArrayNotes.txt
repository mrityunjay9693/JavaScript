In my point of view, this is very common to think and discuss about, why do we need array for storing datas and values,
if we have variables to store any type of values entered by user, then why array?
Let's get dive into this question with the help of example. Let us take we need to store marks of three students as shown 
here: 
Example:let marksOfStudent1 = 85;
        let marksOfStudent2 = 95;
        let marksOfStudent3 = 97;
        console.log("Marks of Students: ");
        console.log(marksOfStudent1);
        console.log(marksOfStudent2);
        console.log(marksOfStudent3);

Now, suppose principle told to display marks of three more students. At this time, the task doesn't looks much hetic and 
again declaring three more varibles along with three more console.log() statement to store and display the marks of another 
three respective students. If there is instruction to store and display marks of another 50 studets, then again writing code
for each students i.e., for another 50 students individually, which is very quite boring an dtime taking task. Actually, the
user has to store and display the marks of each students individually i.e., one by one and which is ofcurse a time taking and
boring and unnecessary task to do. Now, let's considered, if we have more than 500 students. Just think, as a user you are 
told to write code for more than 500 students. Isn't the hectic and time taking task for you. Declaring variables, storing 
marks and then displaying values for 500+ times. Ohh God, its too hectic to do. And, if you observed about the marks of 
students, these are the values of same type i.e., the number type. Thus, we are in such situation where there is a need of 
something which is capable of storing such huge number of values, for example marks of 500 students and solve the problem
and hence we don't need to write code for each values/elements individually. Thus the term "Array" is coined, which is capable
of storing and displaying several number of values/elements together under a single variable name. Let's discuss array in 
depth.

Array : In JavaScript, array is a single variable as well as the most basic data structure and a special type of object to 
        store and manipulate ordered collection of values of same or different datatypes. An array is used to store a collection
        of ordered values/elements of same or different types in a single variable.
      ->An array is an ordered collection of values.
      ->Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic in nature i.e., JavaScript arrays are resizable. They can grow or shrink as needed 
        and hence, there is no need of declaring its fixed size while creating the array.
      ->JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays in nature.
      ->Each value in JavaScript array is called an element and each element has a numeric position in the array, which is 
        known as its index.
      ->JavaScript arrays are zero-based indexing and 32-bit indexes. The first element is at index 0, second is at 2
        and so on. The highest possible index is 4294967294(2^32-2).
 
Syntax for Declaration of an Array: There are two ways for creating an empty array :
                                      1] let arrayName = [];
                                      2] let arrayName = new Array();
