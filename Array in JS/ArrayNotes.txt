In my point of view, this is very common to think and discuss about, why do we need array for storing datas and values,
if we have variables to store any type of values entered by user, then why array?
Let's get dive into this question with the help of example. Let us take we need to store marks of three students as shown 
here: 
Example:let marksOfStudent1 = 85;
        let marksOfStudent2 = 95;
        let marksOfStudent3 = 97;
        console.log("Marks of Students: ");
        console.log(marksOfStudent1);
        console.log(marksOfStudent2);
        console.log(marksOfStudent3);

Now, suppose principle told to display marks of three more students. Then this looks not much easy task. Again declaring 
three more varibles and three more console.log() statement to displayed the marks of another three respective students. 
Actually, here the user has to display the marks of students individually i.e., one by one and ofcurse this is a time 
taking process to be done. The user has written the code for each student's marks individually and it is quite time taking
and boring task to do. And, if you observed about the marks of students, these are the values of same type i.e., 
the. Now, let's considered, if we have more than 500 students. Just think, you as a user told to write code for entering
and displaying the marks of more than 500 students. Isn't the hectic and time taking task for you to declare each variables
and storing marks in all respective variables and then displaying 500+ times. Ohh God, its too hectic to do.
