->In JavaScript, there are various ways to convert a number into string. We can change any given number into string format
  by using following methods: 1] Using toString() method 
                              2] Using the String() function
                              3] Concatenating an Empty String
Now, we will look these ways to convert a number into string one by one:

1] Using toString() method : The toString() method belongs to the Number.Prototype objects which takes an integer or a
                                floating-point number and converts into a string type.
                                Syntax: variableName.toString(); : 
                                here, variableName is any variable which has number value.
                            Ex: let value = 12;
                                let newValue = value.toString(); //converts 12 to a "12" which is a string type
                                console.log(newValue);          // "12"
