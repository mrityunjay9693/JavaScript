Operator:In JavaScript, an operator is defined as the symbol or keyword which is used to performs an operation with
         one or more than one operands to produce a value/result. Here, operands may be variables or values. 
         Operators are the fundamental programming entity to the syntax of the language and these are used for various
         purposes such as arithmetic calculation, comparing the multiple input values, assigning values, and many more.
         From the very above statement, we can understand that operators play very crucial role in the programming 
         language to build a complex programs.
    
    Example: i)5 + 6; : here, + is the operator and, 
                        5,6 are the operands to which the operation is performed.
            ii)x = 7; : here, = is the operator and,
                        7 is the operands to which specific action is performed.
           iii)sum = 6 + 7; here + and + are operators and,
                            6,7 are the operands to which specific action is performed.

Notes: * Operator operates either side of the operands.
       * All complex expressions are joined by operators, such as =, + and many more.
       * Operators are used to manipulate values and operands.
       * Operators are used to compare values, arithmetic operations, decision making and many more.
       * In JavaScript, operator and operands are the fundamentals for building a block of code to 
         perform a specific task and used for manipulation on values.

Operands: An operand is defined as such programming entity such a numeric value or a variable which is being operated
          and manipulated is called operand. An operand a numeric value or variable which is acted by operator. 
          Operator operates operands for manipulate them for specific result. In an expression, these are the inputs 
          for the operators for an operation and the operators define how the operands will combined together and 
          manipulated for a specific result.
          Example:#1 let a =5;
                  #2 let b = 6;
                  #3 let sum = a + b;
                  #4 let c = 2 + 6;
                  #5 console.log(sum, c);
          Output: 11, 8
          Explanation: In the above example,we can see in line number 1 and 2, 5 and 6 are the operands which is assigned 
                       in the variable a and b respectively by the assignment operator(=). And in line number 3, a and b
                       are the operands whose values is manipulated by the plus(+) operator and get assigned to the sum operand
                       by the assignment(=) operator. In line 4, 2 and 6 are the operands which representing the vaues and 
                       plus(+) operator acts upon these values and get assigned in the variable c(an operand) by assignment 
                       operator.
                       5, 6, 2, 6, a, b, sum, c : Operands
                       +, = : Operators

Types of Operator in JavaScript : In JavaScript, based on different operations by the operators there are various 
                                  following mentioned types of operators in JavaScript as shown below:
                                  A)Assignment operator
                                  B)Compariosn operators
                                  c)Arithmetic operators
                                  d)Bitwise operators
                                  e)logical operator
                                  f)BigInt operator
                                  g)String operator
                                  h)Conditional(ternary) operator
                                  i)Comma operator
                                  j)Unary operator
                                  k)Relational operator

A)Assignment operator:In JavaScript, the symbl "=" represents the assignment operator which is used to assign a specific
                      value in a variable which is a left side operand. The value which is assigned in the variable is 
                      another operand available at right side of the assignment operator. The assignment operator generally
                      works with two operands which is avaiable either side of the operator. Ths assignment operator takes 
                      the right side operand's value and assigns it to the right side operand which is basically a variable.
                      The symbol "=" is the simple and basic assignment operator which we already used many times before.
                      The right side operand may be either a value or a variable which has some value to be assigned to the
                      left side operand. 
                      
                      Example:a)let num = 45;
                                console.log(num);
                                here, num and 45 are left side and right side operands respectively.
                                      "=" is the assignment operator.
                              
                              b)let num1 = 12;
                                let num2 = num1;
                                console.log(num2); // num2 : 12
                                here, both are the operand either side of the assignment operator.  

->In the above examples, we have seen the simple and basic assignment operator work. Now, suppose we have a variable, num 
  has the value 5(num = 5). Now, I told you to increase the value of num by 2. Here, we will do like this:
  let num = 5;
  num = num + 2;
  In the above code, you have done your according to instruction that was told to you. But, if you were aware with the
  compound assignment operator, which is the combination of mathmatical operation with the assignment then you will do 
  something like this:
  let num = 5;
  num += 2; // num += 2 -> num = num + 2;  
  
->This is an example of compound assignment operator which is along with different other operator with simple assignment
  operator. There are assignment operator which is a combined form of other operators along with assignment operators
  as mentioned below:
   i)Addition assignment operator.
  ii)Subtraction assignment operator.
 iii)Multiplication assignment operator.
  iv)Division assignment operator.
   v)Remainder assignment operator.
  vi)Exponential assihnment operator.  
 vii)Left shift assignment operator.
viii)Right shift assignment operator.



B)Compariosn Operator:
