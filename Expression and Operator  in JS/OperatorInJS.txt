Operator:In JavaScript, an operator is defined as the symbol or keyword which is used to performs an operation with
         one or more than one operands to produce a value/result. Here, operands may be variables or values. 
         Operators are the fundamental programming entity to the syntax of the language and these are used for various
         purposes such as arithmetic calculation, comparing the multiple input values, assigning values, and many more.
         From the very above statement, we can understand that operators play very crucial role in the programming 
         language to build a complex programs.
    
    Example: i)5 + 6; : here, + is the operator and, 
                        5,6 are the operands to which the operation is performed.
            ii)x = 7; : here, = is the operator and,
                        7 is the operands to which specific action is performed.
           iii)sum = 6 + 7; here + and + are operators and,
                            6,7 are the operands to which specific action is performed.
