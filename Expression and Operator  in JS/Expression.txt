Hello everyone. I welcome you all in the chapter of Expressions and Operator in JavaScript. Here we will explore all
aspects of Expressions and operator in details like assignment, comparison, logical, bitwise and many more. Let's 
disuss these things.

Expression: Expression is defined as a block of code that produces a resultant value afer being evaluated or resolved
            It consists of variable in which value to be stored, value and operators. An expression can be a literal,
            or a single value and it can be a simple/complex combination of variables, operators, and literals. It is 
            the essential part of JavaScript which is used by programmer to perform any operation, used to make a 
            decision, creating more complex logic in the code. More than one expression can be combined together and 
            nested to create sophisticated programs. 
            
            Examples: a)num = 20; //Assignment expression.
                      b)x = 5 + 15; //combination of arithmetic and assignment expression.
                      c)5+6; // arithmetic expression.
                      d)x+y; //arithmetic expression.
                      e)'5', 'Hello World', 'true', 'false', [1,3,4] // literals values. 
        
          ->We can clearly observed that there are possibly two types of expressions:
            a)Expressions with Side Effects.
            b)Purely Evaluating Expressions. 











typeof Operator: The typeof operator in JavaScript is used to return the datatype of the operand in the form of string.
                 The operand may be a literal or a data structure like a variable, a function or it may be an object.
                 This operator is generally used, if we want to know or check the type of variable ehic used in the code.
                 
                 Syntax : typeof (operand); or typeof operand
