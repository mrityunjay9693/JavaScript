JavaScript: JavaScript is a leight-weight, high-level interpreted programming language which is dynamic in nature. It is 
            primarly used for building interactive and dynamic web-pages and web applications.
           *JavaScript is a "backward compatible programming language". This means, it will support all the features which
            came many years ago.
           *JavaScript is not "forward compatible programming language". This means if you are using loder version of your 
            browser and using current featuresof JS, then that features will not support in your browser with older 
            version. You have to keep update your browser time to time.


****************************************************Variables**************************************************************

Variables:->Variable in JavaScript is the most basic building block programming entity which is used to store information.
            And, these information can be used in the program later and if possible, can be altred. 
          ->In other words it can be defined as : Variable is an container which is used to store a value like like a 
            number or string and can store any type of JavaScript values.
          ->A variable is a named container for a particular set of bits or type of data like integer, float, string etc.
          ->A variable in JavaScript is a named storage for data.
          ->Variable name in JavaScript in case-sensitive.
    
          ->Variable in JavaScript is the most basic building block programming entity which is used to :
              a)store information.
              b)and,these information can be used in the program later 
              c)and, if possible, can be altred/changed. 
          
          ->Variable name in JavaScript in case-sensitive.
    
 Creation/Declaration of Variable in JS :
        ->Systax : 
                  var/let/const variable_name = values;  
                    
                    eg: 1)var num = 12;
                          let num1 = 123;
                          const name1 = "JavaScript."
                          console.log(num, num1, name1);
                    output: 12, 123, JavaScript.
            
        * values/data/information can be : an integer, a string etc.
        * var/let/const are the keyword in JavaScript which is used to create any programming entity as variable.

Rules for naming "variable": Following are the rules while naming a variable described as below: 
      1.First character of a variable should not be any digit/number.We cannot start naming variable with 
        digit/number.
      2.While naming a variable name, a letter(alphabets), dollar sign($), and an underscore sign( _ ) can be used as 
        first character of a variable name.
      3.Only dollar sign($) and underscore( _ ) are the special symbols allowed for naming a variable name. Apart from dollar 
        sign and underscore, other special characters are not allowed.
      3.Spaces are not allowed within the characters of a variable name.
      4.Reserved keywords are not allowed for naming a variable name.
      5.Variable names are case-sensitive and we must takle care about its case.
      6.We use camelCase while naming a variable name in JavaScript. camelCase is the naming convention for naming a variable.
 
**************************************************----String----**************************************************************

String:-> String is defined as the sequence of characters or collection of characters is called string.
       -> In JavaScript, anything you write down within the pair of single/double quotation mark is known as string. 
       -> Values within the pair of single/double quotation are string whic are made up of sequence of characters, 
          consists of letters, numbers, symbol, and even emojis.

Creating of Strings:->Strings in JavaScript can be created in two ways, either putting values in quotations 
                      or as object. The two ways for creating strings in JS ,emtioned below:
                      a)String created as primitives, from string literals(putting values in quotes)
                      b)String created as object, using the String() constructor(new String()).

POINTS: a)In JavaScript's string, every character of the string has its own index i.e,, position.
        b)Index/position of characters in string starting from Zero(0) that means it is Zero-based( based) indexing.
