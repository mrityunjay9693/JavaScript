Conversion of of Number type to String type: 
->In JavaScript, there are various ways to convert a number into string. We can change any given number into string 
  format by using following methods:1] Using toString() method 
                                    2] Using the String() function
                                    3] Concatenating an Empty String

Now, we will look these ways to convert a number into string one by one:

1] Using toString() method: The toString() method belongs to the Number.Prototype objects which takes an integer or a
                            floating-point number and converts into a string type. While converting a number into string
                            type, make sure that number should not be "undefined" or "null".
                            Syntax: variableName.toString(); : 
                            here, variableName is any variable which has number value.
                            Ex: let value = 12;
                                let newValue = value.toString(); //converts 12 to a "12" which is a string type
                                console.log(newValue);          // "12"

2] Using the String() function: Here, the String() method which is used to convert a number(integer or floating-point)
                                into string type is a constructor, use to convert a number value into string type. It 
                                takes the number(integer or floating-point) as a parameter for converting it into 
                                string type. Here, if we pass value such as "null" or "undedined" then it will returned 
                                null and undedined Strings respectively.
                                Syntax: String(object); or String(parameter); 
                                here, object/parameter has number value.
                                Ex: let value = 12;
                                let newValue = String(value); //converts 12 to a "12" which is a string type
                                console.log(newValue);       // "12"

3]Concatenating an Empty String:By adding/Concatenating an empty string with the given number value
                                (integer/floating-point) is most easy job to convert the given number value 
                                to string type. By adding an empty string will internally be converted to String.
                                
                                Syntax: let variableName = value + " "; 
                                    or, let variableName = '' + value;
                                here, " "/'' is an empty string.
                                Ex: let value = 12;
                                let newValue = value + ""; //empty string will converts 12 to a "12" : string type
                                console.log(newValue);       // "12"
                                console.log(typrof newValue); // String
