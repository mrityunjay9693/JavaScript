                                      Variables

Variables:->Variable in JavaScript is the most basic building block programming entity which is used to store  information. And, these information can be used in the program later and if possible, can be altred. In other words it can be defined as : Variable is an container which is used to store a value like like a number or string and can store any type of JavaScript values.
          ->A variable is a named container for a particular set of bits or type of data like integer, float, string etc.
          ->A variable in JavaScript is a named storage for data.
          ->Variable name in JavaScript in case-sensitive.

          ->Variable in JavaScript is the most basic building block programming entity which is used to :
            a)store information.
            b)and,these information can be used in the program later 
            c)and, if possible, can be altred/changed. 

Creation/Declaration of Variable in JS :
                                        Systax : keyword variable_name = values;  

                                        Example: var num = 12;
                                                 let num1 = 123;
                                                 const name1 = "JavaScript."
                                                 console.log(num, num1, name1);
                                                 output: 12, 123, JavaScript.
        * Here, var, let, const are keywords in JS using for variable declaration. (we will discuss later)  
        * values/data/information can be : an integer, a string etc.
        * var/let/const are the keyword in JavaScript which is used to create any programming entity as variable.

Rules for naming "variable": Following are the rules while naming a variable described as below:
      1.First character of a variable should not be any digit/number.We cannot start naming variable with a digit/number.
      2.While naming a variable name, a letter(alphabets), dollar sign($), and an underscore sign( _ ) can be used as
        first character of a variable name.
      3.Only dollar sign($) and underscore( _ ) are the special symbols allowed for naming a variable name. Apart from dollar
        sign and underscore, other special characters are not allowed.
      3.Spaces are not allowed within the characters of a variable name.
      4.Reserved keywords are not allowed for naming a variable name.
      5.Variable names are case-sensitive and we must takle care about its case.
      6.We use camelCase while naming a variable name in JavaScript. camelCase is the naming convention for naming a variable.

In JavaScript, variable is declared using following keyword: 1) var
                                                             2) let
                                                             3) const

1) var : "var" is a keyword which is used for declaration of a variable in JavaScript. The var keyword was introduced in JavaScript from very beginning, in its first version which was released in 1995 by Netscape. var is the only way to declare variable in JavaScript until let and const are introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in 2015.

      -> Syntax : var variable_name = value;

->Variables can store soome information and values in it.
->We can use that information later in the program.
->We can also alter the information later in the program.

  Example:
          //Declaration of a variable.
          var firstName = "Mrityunjay";

          //Use of the varaible firstName
          console.log("First Name: "+firstName);

->Altering the existing value/information of the variable firstName. Now, we don't need to re-declare the variable while  giving some value i.e., while altering it.

          firstName = "Mrinal";
          console.log("After alter, the First Name: "+firstName);

->if, we use 'var' keyword with the same variable i.e., firstName, then another firstName variable will be created, since we have added the 'var' keyword along with the firstName.
          var firstName = "Mohit";
          console.log("Another firstName variable is created, firstName: "+firstName);
