Tytype conversion: In programming language, the process converting data set of one type to another type is called 
                   type conversion.

String to Number type conversin in JS:
-> There are several situation where conversion of string type to number type is performed and JavaScript provides 
   many features/built-in method as well as operator to convert string input to a number value. The concept in which
   the conversion of string type to number type is known as "type conversion". Following are the ways to convert a
   String type to Number type in JS are mentioned below:
   1]Using parseInt() Function/Method.
   3]Using parseFloat() Function/Method.
   2]Using Number() Function/Method.
   3]Using Unary(plus) Operator(+).
   4]Using Math.Floor() Function/Method.
   5]Multipy String with number 1.
   6]Using Double tilde(~ ~) Operator.

1]Using parseInt() method: The parseInt() method is used in JavaScript to convert the String type input to Number type.
                           The parseInt() method/function takes takes a string and convert it into an integer value.
                           The parseInt() method/function returns an integer value. If you pass a decimal value then
                           it will return you integer value. It ignores the value after decimal point.    
                           The parseInt() method/function takes two parameter mentioned as below:->
                           a)String value: The first parameter is the input string value to be converted into integer.
                           b)radix: The second parameter is radix value whic is used to represent base of the number 
                                    into which the output will be displayed which contains numbers between 2 and 36.
                                    The radix parameter is optional and if not pass as parameter then by default, its
                                    value will be 10 i.e., decimal system.
                           
                           Syntax: parseInt(stringVariable, radix); or,
                                   parseInt(stringVariable); 
Note: Passing a non-string value as stringVariable will led to SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier.
