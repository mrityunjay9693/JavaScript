Traditionally before ES6, we have two ways two create a string i.e., 
a)using single quotation('string literals wrap using single quotes') and
b)using double quotation('string literals wrap using single quotes'). 

Using above mentioned ways, if we create strings then the strings have have very limited functionalities and features.
To overcome the limitations, ES6 provides a new way(features) to create a string i.e., "Template Literal" which gives a 
programmer more control over dynamic string. After the ECMAScript6 or ES6 introduced/released, Template Literal comes 
into existence which allows us to work with strings more easily, safely and cleanly.  
We already created strings using single and double quotations, for eg: str1 = "String" and str2 = 'Strings'. Now using 
backtick(``), we are able to create a string. So, there are three ways of writing string in JavaScript :->
1)Using single quotation('string').
2)Using double quotation("string").
3)Using backtick(`string`).

Template literals:-> Template literals are such literals which is written/created within backtick(`literals`) 
                     characters within which we are allowed to write strings and allowing for multi-line strings,
                     untagged template literals results in strings which makes useful for string interpolation 
                     and multiline strings, allowed us to embed expressions and special constructs called tagged
                     tagged templates.
                  -> Template literals in JavaScript are literals which is created with the help of backticks(``)
                     characters within which we can write strings and add placeholders inside backticks characters
                     (``).
                  -> Template literals are also lnown as "template strings" and it is the informal name of template 
                     strings. This is because, we mostly work with strings and string interpolation within backtick(``) 
                     characters.
                  -> untagged template literals results in strings and tagged template literals may not results
                     in string but it can be used with a customized tag function to perform whatever operation we
                     want to perform on the different parts of the template literal.
                  -> Template literals are ES6 new features added to JavaScript to create strings mainly with
                     dynamic strings and it allows users to embeded expression. These expressions can be a 
                     number or a string or a variable or constant of any data type which is used inside placeholder.
            Stntax:
                     let/var/ varialeName = `string/text`;
                  or `text/string`;  
         Example: let str = `Template String.`;  // writing string inside backtick characters.
                  console.log(str); // Template String.

Let's understand the benefits of using backtick characters for writing string or template strings. In below example, we have
information about a student i.e., its name, roll number, branch, College nameaddress. And we will return a statement as ouput,
its information using double quotation or single quotation and return statement(output) will be like : 

Output: My name is Mrityunjay Kumar, Roll number is MCAL0030, I am a MCA students of JainUniversity.

Now, following is the code snippet in which student's information is taken and will be stored in the variable as shown below:

   let studentName = "Mrityunjay Kumar,";
   let rollNumber = "MCAL0030,";
   let branch = "MCA";
   let collegeName = "Jain University.";

Now, if we want to achieve the above output, let's achieve this traditionally i.e., using double/single quotation, where 
the resulting string is broken into parts. A string "My name is" is taken and it is concatenated with the studentName 
input using "+" operator. Then an another string "Roll number is" is concatenated with rollNumber input and "I am a" is 
concatenated with branch input and finally "students of" is concatenated with CollegeName input. All these concatenation
is done using "+" operator. This whole process is looked like this:
Return statement: 

   console.log("My name is " + studentName + " Roll number is " + rollNumber + " I am a " + branch + " students of " + collegeName);

The above return statement for result output which we are using to achieve the output is looks like very tedious work and time
taking process. We can make it very simple, easier and time efficient work by using template literals where both string part 
and inputs(i.e., studentName, rollNumber etc) are written within backtick characters. Here, inputs variable are embeded inside 
backtick characters along with strings and this is an example of the statement "template literals allows us to embed expressions"

Note : Here, input variables which are embed inside backtick(``) are the placeholder. Placeholder can contain variables or 
       expression.

Return statement using backtick characters:

   console.log(`My name is ${studentName}` Roll number is ${rollNumber} I am a ${branch} students of ${collegeName}`)

Output: My name is Mrityunjay Kumar Roll number is MCAL0030 I am a MCA students of JainUniversity.
      
      
Examples: 


Placeholder: The placeholder in template literals are declared by the help of "${}"(read as dollar with curly braces). The 
             placeholder is the programming entity which has some kind of values such as number, string, constant. The Variable, 
             expression, a constant or arithmetic expression, etc which is written inside the curly braces attached with 
             dollar($) sign is the placeholder and it can be the value of any data type.

          -> ${placeholder}, Where placeholder : Variable, expression, a constant or arithmetic expression, etc
             Ex:let studentName = `Mrityunjay Kumar` 
                let totalMarks = 451;
                let studentInfo = `Total marks of ${studentName} : ${totalMarks}`;
                console.log(studentInfo);
        Output: Total marks of Mrityunjay Kumar : 451
        Here, studentName, totalMarks are the variables used here which are placeholders. 
          ->If, you are unable to find out where is backtick sign available on the keyboard then, the you will get it on 
            the top-left of the keyboard just below Esc key button and just above the tab key button.
